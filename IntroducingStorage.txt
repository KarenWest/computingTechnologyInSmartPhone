Now, combinational logic is great.
It's allowed us to build an adder and other useful functions such as decoders
and multiplexers that will be very handy later on when we build our computer.
But what we're lacking is storage.
Now when I mean storage, I'm not talking about the storage
that you have on your smartphone to hold your apps.
I'm talking about storage to hold intermediate results.
So think about a long calculation that you might
do, for instance, on your calculator.
Now, you need to store intermediate values
on the way to getting to the final result.
So we're going to talk about storage elements that
are used to hold these intermediate values,
and there are two types weâ€™re going to talk about.
One is a D latch and another is a D flip-flop.
Now, a D latch is very handy for building memories, which
are going to be useful later on to hold our instructions and data when we build
our computer, and the D flip-flop is useful for building
a special type of circuit called sequential logic circuits.
So let's get into it.
