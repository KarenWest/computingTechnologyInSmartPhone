Now let's recap what we've covered in the last eight weeks.
We've gone through the computing technology stack, the hardware
and software layers of a computer system, and their interaction.
Then we learned the advanced performance techniques
that computer architects use to make our smartphones so fast.
Then we went into the details of Snapdragon SOCs,
and we went into very deep detail on the Crate CPU.
And we also did a lot of design.
We designed digital logic, and finally we designed a working computer.
Now let's discuss next steps-- so where you can go from here with the knowledge
you've gained in this course.
Well, first of all, you might want to fill out your knowledge
through additional online education.
You can take a full blown digital logic design course.
After that, you can look into a computer architecture course.
If you're interested in doing programming
and you haven't done programming before, you could take a programming course.
You can go one layer lower in the stack, and investigate
circuits, microelectronics, and VLSI-- Very Large Scale Integration,
or chip design.
Or you can investigate embedded systems where
you use a microprocessor or a microcontroller
to build a system, for instance, to control a robot.
Alternatively, you can learn all of these topics
by pursuing a Computer Engineering Bachelor's degree.
