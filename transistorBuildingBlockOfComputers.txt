The transistor is the building block of computers.
Microprocessors, which are the computer chips
that power our smartphones, our laptops, servers in the cloud,
contain billions of transistors.
Your smartphone, for instance, the little computer chip,
the microprocessor in that, may contain a few billion transistors.
Servers in the cloud may have over 5 billion transistors
in their microprocessors.
Now, each of these transistors acts like a tiny little switch,
and we can combine these transistors to create logic functions-- we've already
talked about AND, OR, and NOT we're going
to create the hardware to do those operations using transistors.
Then we're going to take those logic functions-- those
AND, OR, NOT and we're going to build more useful things, such as adders,
such as things called multiplexers, decoders,
registers, which we use to store values.
And then we're going to use those as the building blocks to build a processor,
and we're going to build a processor called the LC-3.
Now, this gets back to the idea of hierarchy
where we have a transistor as a building block, and we go one level up
and we can use that to create these logic functions.
One level above that is we use these to create things like adders,
and then another level above that is we use these adders and other things
to build this processor, which we're calling the LC-3.
