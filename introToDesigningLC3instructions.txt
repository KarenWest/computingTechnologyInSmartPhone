Now, we're going to see digital logic and computer
organization come together.
We understand the phases of instruction processing for two instructions, ADD
and LDR, and we're ready to put our digital design
skills to work in building up the LC-3 micro architecture.
Now, we're going to do this step by step starting with the hardware
design for instruction fetch, moving on to decode, evaluate address, execute,
and finally store result.
Now, at the end of this module, you'll see a working LC-3 computer start
to come together for those two instructions.
Weâ€™ll even see the finite state machine control design for those instructions
as well.
Now, we will be equipped to move on from this module
to fill out a full instruction set and the full LC-3 implementation.
So let's get into it.
