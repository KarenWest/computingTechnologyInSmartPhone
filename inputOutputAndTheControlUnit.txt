The way we interact with a computer, like our smartphone,
is through input and output.
Now, our permanent storage is also an input/output device.
So this could be like a keyboard or a mouse or a monitor or a printer,
or it could be the flash memory in your smartphone.
Now, these are devices that put data into and get data out
of computer memory.
So the input/output devices interact with the computer memory.
Now, each device has its own interface, just like memory has interface.
Now, for LC-3, we have two input/output devices.
For input, we use the keyboard, and for output, we use the monitor.
The keyboard has a data register, called the KBDR, and a status register,
or the KBSR.
And the monitor has a data register, called
the DDR for the display data register, and a status register, called the DSR.
Now, we're going to cover these later on in the course.
Now, some devices provide both input and output.
So your network provides both input and output.
Your flash memory provides both input and output in your smartphone.
And there's a special piece of software that controls access to a device.
And that's called a driver.
The final piece of our von Neumann machine is the control unit.
So this orchestrates the execution of the program.
And it has two main components-- one, the instruction register,
which holds the current instruction-- this is the instruction that we're
operating on right now-- and also the program counter or PC, which
holds the memory address of the next instruction that we're going to execute
after this current one.
Now, the control unit reads an instruction from the memory.
And the address is in the PC.
And it interprets that instruction.
It determines what type of instruction it is, such as an add versus a load,
for instance.
And it generates all of the signals, all of the control that's
needed to tell the other components what to do in order to carry out
the execution of this instruction.
