Let's review a D latch and a D flip-flop.
With a D latch, the output follows the input when the write enable is a one.
That's when the latch is open.
Now when the latch is closed, that means a write enable is zero,
then the input is captured.
And we use a D latch as a building block for memories.
With a D flip-flop on the other hand, the output
changes only on the triggering clock edge.
