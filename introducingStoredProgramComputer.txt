This module covers the stored program computer,
which is the fundamental way in which computers are organized,
including the one in your smartphone.
Now, this is also called a Von Neumann machine after John Von Neumann,
and the stored program computer, like many concepts in computer systems,
can be attributed to many different people.
There are many people who can claim credit for this.
Now, in Von Neumann's case, he joined a group
of researchers at the University of Pennsylvania,
specifically two pioneering researchers--
John Mauchley and Pres Eckert-- who had developed
a landmark machine called the ENIAC, and were working
on a new machine called the EDVAC.
Now, the EDVAC had a lot of different concepts,
and Von Neumann wrote a draft report on the machine.
And that report was obtained and circulated widely,
and so it had a lot of influence.
And even though Von Neumann wasn't the only person,
certainly, who came up with this idea of the stored program computer--
you could say that other people, such as Eckert and Mauchley,
could claim credit-- he became the person who got the credit for it.
So that's why we call it the Von Neumann architecture.
Now, it has some fundamental components that we use today.
It has a processing unit, it has a memory input output, and a control
unit.
We're going to talk about those fundamental components
and describe their overall operation, and then later on we're
going to get more into detail on each one of those.
So let's get into it.
