Our control unit orchestrates these phases of execution
and that's implemented as a finite state machine.
Here's a simplified state diagram which we're going
to expand on later on in the course.
The first three states are instruction fetch,
and those happen over three cycles of execution.
In the first phase, we take the contents of the PC
and we load that into the MAR register.
We also increment the PC and update the PC with that incremented value.
In the next state, the next clock cycle, we read the memory
at that address that's in the MAR and we put that instruction
into the MDR register.
Then the third step, the third cycle of instruction
fetch, we take the contents of MDR, we transfer it over the bus
and that gets loaded into the IR register.
Now that we have our instruction, we're ready to decode it and then determine
the next sequence of steps and that's done in the decode stage
when we look at the leftmost 4 bits, the opcode,
and that tells us what to do subsequently.
Now that you can see that after decode, we go through a set
of steps that are specific to the type of instruction
and then finally we go back to the first step and fetch the next instruction.
Now we have a foundation that we can build on
to fill out the rest of our LC-3 instruction set,
which we're going to do in the next few modules.
