Here's the complete LC-3 instruction set.
We've covered the operate instructions, ADD, AND, and NOT;
the memory instructions, load and store; and the control instructions, branch,
jump, and trap.
We haven't covered JSR, JSRR, RET, and RTI,
but you can read about those in the Patton/Patel textbook.
Now, the value for source register 2 is always bits 2 through 0.
But for source register 1, it differs depending on the instruction.
For the operate instructions, that's bits 8 through 6.
But for the store instructions, that's bits 11 through 9.
Those bits for store denote the location of the value
that we're going to put into memory.
That means we need to add another multiplexer to our LC-3
micro-architecture, one that picks 1 of those source register values or another
in order to send that to the register file as SR1.
And the finite state machine control will pick 1 value or the other
depending on the type of instruction.
