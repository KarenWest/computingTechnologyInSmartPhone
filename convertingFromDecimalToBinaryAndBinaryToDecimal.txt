Now that we've seen binary numbers, let's
discuss how we convert between these different number systems.
Let's start by talking about how we convert from binary--
and here we're talking about 2's complement-- to decimal.
The way we do this is we add powers of 2 for all
of the bit positions that have a 1.
Now we need to keep in mind that the leftmost bit, the most significant bit,
has negative weight.
We're going to do a couple of examples.
And let's use this table where we have for every n, every value of n,
what the value of 2 to the n is in decimal.
Let's take an example where x equals 01101000 in base 2.
Again, what we do is we look at all the positions where we have a 1.
Now remember the rightmost position has weight 2 to the 0.
The next position after that has weight 2 to the 1, and so on and so forth.
So the leftmost 1 here has weight 2 to the 6.
So we write down 2 to the 6.
The next position after that to the right has weight 2 to the fifth,
so we add that.
And then the final 1 that we see is in the 2 to the third position,
so we put down 2 to the third.
Now this equals 64 plus 32 plus 8, which is 104 in base 10.
Let's look at now a negative number.
Now how do we know that it's negative?
Well, the MSB is a 1, leftmost bit here is a 1.
So that means we have a negative number.
Now again this is a 2's complement number,
so that leftmost bit has negative weight.
So we write minus 2 to the seventh.
Then we add the next position, which is positive 2 to the sixth plus 2
to the fifth plus 2 to the second plus 2 to the first, which is minus 128
plus 64 plus 32 plus 4 plus 2, or minus 26.
It's a negative number, as you see.
Leftmost bit is a 1 so this is minus 26 in base 10.
Let's now go the other way.
Let's convert from a decimal number to binary.
And again, we're talking about 2's complement numbers here.
There's two methods that we're going to talk about.
The first method involves division.
The first thing that we do in both of these methods
is we change to a positive decimal number.
So if we have a negative sign there, we just get rid of that negative sign.
Then we divide by 2.
And the remainder is the least significant bit.
And we keep dividing by 2 until the answer is 0.
And then we record the remainders from right to left to get our number.
Now we always append a 0 as the MSB.
And if the original number, original decimal number, was negative,
then we need to take the 2's complement to get the negative representation.
Here's an example where x is 104 in base 10.
So we go through our procedure here, where we divide by 2.
We take 104, divide by 2, that gives us 52 with a remainder of 0.
So that means bit 0 is going to be 0.
And we take that 52.
Again, we divide by 2.
That gives us 26.
Again, a remainder of 0.
So bit 1 is a 0.
Continue dividing.
So we divide 26.
We get 13.
We divide 13 by 2.
Now here we get 6 with a remainder of 1, so that means bit 3 is going to be a 1,
continually dividing until our result, when we divide 1 by 2, is 0.
Again, we've got to make sure we keep track of the remainder.
Remainder is 1.
That means bit 6 is going to be a 1.
And then we append a 0 to the leftmost bit.
So here's our final result, x equals 01101000.
Here's the second method.
And you can use either method.
Both methods work well.
They give you the right result.
The second method is to subtract powers of 2.
So again, just like the first method, we first
start with a positive decimal number.
And then we subtract the largest power of 2 that is less than
or equal to the number.
I have this handy table that we used before when
we converted from binary to decimal.
Now what we do then is we put a 1 in the corresponding bit position
after we do the step.
And we keep subtracting these largest powers of 2 until the result is 0.
Then we do the same thing.
We append a 0 to the most significant bit.
If the original was negative, we take the 2's complement.
Here's our example of 104 base 10.
The largest power of 2 that we could subtract from that is 64.
Now that means that bit 6, because 2 to the 6 is 64, bit 6 is going to be a 1
in our result.
Then we subtract 64 from 104.
That gives us 40.
And we do the same procedure.
The largest power of 2 now is 32, that's 2 to the 5.
So bit 5 is going to be a 1 in our result.
That gives us 8 after we do that subtraction.
And then the largest power of 2 that we can subtract from that is 8.
And that's to the third, so bit three's going to be a 1.
And then we append a 0.
And here's our result.
It's exactly the same as what we did in our first method.
