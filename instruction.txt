Let's start with the instruction, which is the fundamental unit of work
in a computer.
And a computer program contains many, many instructions.
Now, an instruction has two important groups of bits, which we call fields.
And the first field is the opcode.
This tells us the operation to be performed,
whether it be an add, an and, or a load.
And the second field is the operands field.
This holds the actual data we're going to operate on
or the locations of data in our registers for the operation.
Now, this is encoded as a bunch of bits.
It's simply just a bunch of 1s and 0s just like data.
And an instruction may have a fixed length, such as 16 bits or 32 bits.
In LC-3, each instruction is 16 bits.
Now, the control unit interprets each instruction,
and it generates a sequence of signals to carry out
the operation depending on the type of instruction that we have.
