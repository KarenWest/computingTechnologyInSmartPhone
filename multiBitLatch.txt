Now, we need to be able to capture more than one bit,
and we can do this with a multi-bit latch.
A multi-bit latch simultaneously latches multiple bits.
Now when you hear the term latch, that can refer
to a one bit latch or a multi-bit one.
Here's an example of a four bit latch.
I have four data inputs, D1 through D4, and I have my outputs Q1 through Q4.
But I have a single write enable that goes to all four of those latches.
So D1 through D4 are simultaneously captured by WE.
And so the outputs Q1 through Q4 also change at the same time.
Now we can do the same thing with flip-flops.
And that's called a register, which is a collection of flip-flops
that operates off of a common clock.
Now a single d flip-flop is referred to as a 1-bit register.
Here's an example of a 4-bit register.
I have four D flip-flops.
Four inputs, D1 through D4 and my outputs Q1 through Q4,
and I have one clock signal that goes to all the clock
inputs of my four D flip-flops.
So when the clock changes from 0 to 1, then all of the flip-flops
will trigger.
That means the outputs Q1 through Q4 will change the input values
D1 through D4 simultaneously.
Now just like with the d flip-flop, we can have set
reset capability and load capability.
In this case, we'll simultaneously set or reset all four flip-flops
and we'll simultaneously load or hold the values of all four flip-flops
with one load signal.
