Here's our first phase instruction fetch,
which is carried out over several clock cycles.
In the first cycle, the PC is sent over the bus to the memory address register.
Then that's sent to the memory, and the instruction, the desired instruction,
is put into the MDR register.
Finally, the contents of the MDR register are sent over the bus
and loaded into the instruction register.
In instruction decode, the opcode is decoded
by the finite state machine, which tells it the subsequent steps
to be carried out.
