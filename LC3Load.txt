Now for a load or store in the evaluate address phase,
we need to add our sign extended offset to the value from the base register,
and then we need to put that out onto the bus
and send it to the memory address register.
Now in the next phase, operand fetch, we're
going to use different hardware depending on whether we're
doing a load or an add.
Let's start with a load.
With a load instruction we're going to take the address in the MAR,
send it to the memory, and then that's going
to put the requested data into the MDR register.
For an add we're going to read our two source values from our register file
and send them to the ALU.
For the execute phase that takes place for an add instruction,
then we do the addition within the ALU.
