Now that we've seen numbers and the operations that we can perform on them,
let's build some hardware.
Now, we're going to leverage this idea of a stack, of a hierarchy,
and start from the bottom and work our way up.
And for us, the bottom is the transistor.
Now, your smartphone contains billions of these tiny switches
called transistors.
Now, it acts in a similar way as a light switch.
So when you flip the switch on, then the current
can flow between the other two terminals.
When you flip it off, then that connection
is broken and no current flows.
Now, we're going to work from a transistor up to logic gates.
Now, logic gates perform these logic functions-- these AND, OR, and NOT--
and we're going to introduce a couple of others called NAND and NOR.
And after we finish this module and we've introduced these
and you understand how they work, we're going to move into the next module
to build up some interesting digital functions from them.
So let's get into it.
