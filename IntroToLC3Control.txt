We've come a long way so far.
We've taken our digital logic design skills
and applied them to the design of an LC-3 computer system.
We understand instruction set architecture.
We know the LC-3 instruction formats, as well as memory addressing modes.
And we've learned how to design an LC-3 computer from a hardware perspective.
We've used our digital logic skills to implement the LC-3 instruction set.
Now, we're missing one very important last piece in this computer
organization part of the course, and that's
the design of the control unit, which is an integral part of a Von Neumann
machine.
Now, we've alluded to this in our LC-3 diagrams.
We had that black called the finite state machine control.
But we need to get into the details of how that's implemented.
And that's the subject of this module.
We're going to go through all of the states
in an LC-3 state diagram that implements the control unit.
We're first going to start with instruction fetch and instruction
decode.
These are states that we handle for every instruction.
And then we're going to go through some specific instructions--
an operate instruction, a memory instruction, and a control
instruction so we understand how those work as well.
So let's get into it.
