When we think of computers, we think of computation, of arithmetic.
In this module, we're going to build an adder and a subtractor.
Now, the adder or subtractor that we're going to build
is what's called a ripple carry adder, and it's
built using what's called modular design where we start with a basic hardware
building block and we replicate that as many times as we
need to build our adder.
And the basic building block we're going to start with
is what's called a full bit adder.
You could think of this as a complete adder for 1-bit position.
And what we're going to do is once we've designed
that, we're going to replicate that as many times as we
need to make our complete adder.
Now, it turns out that a subtractor is very similar,
and this is due to the properties of two's complement arithmetic.
Remember, with two's complement what we do instead of doing subtracting
is we form the two's complement first, and then we do addition.
So our adder and subtractor are going to be very, very similar.
We're going to have just one design that does both.
So let's get into it.
