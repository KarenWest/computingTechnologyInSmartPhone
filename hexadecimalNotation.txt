Hexadecimal notation, or base 16, is a convenient way for us
to represent binary numbers.
Now, if you have a long binary number with lots of 1's and 0's, it can be
kind of dizzying to look at all those 1's and 0's.
And you can actually make mistakes.
You might miss a 0 or miss a 1.
So it's convenient to write out binary numbers, especially long ones that
are in base 2, as hexadecimal base 16 numbers.
This gives us fewer digits, because for every four bits,
there's a single hex digit.
And it's less error prone.
It's easy to misread these long strings of 1's and 0's.
Here's a table using 4-bit binary numbers, so 16 total values,
and the equivalent hex value as well as the decimal value.
Now, you see all the way from 000 to 1001, which is the decimal number 9,
hex is the exact same as decimal.
Now, once we get to 10, with decimal we have
to have two characters to represent that and we just
want to represent this with one, so with hex what do we do?
Well, we just start with the alphabet and we use capital letters.
So 10 is A, 11 is B, all the way up to 15, which is F.
