Now that weâ€™ve seen the general organization of a stored program
computer, we're ready to get into the details.
Now, I mentioned we have two main topics in this section of the course.
One is microarchitecture.
And the other is instruction set architecture.
And we need to move fluidly between these two
in order to understand the whole picture.
So in order to understand microarchitecture,
we have to have some idea of what instructions are.
So in this module, we're going to cover basic instruction formats
and look at a couple of specific LC-3 Instructions.
Now, that's going to allow us to get a general idea of what
the hardware needs to do.
And we're going to end with the overall phases of instruction processing
that the microarchitecture needs to perform in order
to execute those instructions.
Now once we've done this, get this general idea of what the hardware needs
to do, in the next module, we're going to get very deep into the details.
So let's get into it.
